Postmortem Report
Issue Summary
Duration: August 23, 2024, 14:00 UTC - August 23, 2024, 16:30 UTC (2 hours and 30 minutes)

Impact: 50% of users were unable to access the main website, experiencing slow load times or complete timeouts. This issue affected both desktop and mobile users.

Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the load balancer was the root cause. It routed all traffic to a single server, leading to server overload and subsequent failure.

Timeline
14:00 UTC: Monitoring alerts indicated a significant drop in successful HTTP requests, marking the start of the issue.
14:05 UTC: The DevOps team received an automated alert from the monitoring system.
14:10 UTC: Initial investigation began, focusing on web server performance.
14:20 UTC: Debugging led the team to suspect a database issue due to slightly elevated response times.
14:45 UTC: Further investigation identified that the load balancer was misconfigured.
15:00 UTC: The incident was escalated to the network engineering team to address the load balancer issue.
15:30 UTC: The load balancer configuration was corrected, redistributing traffic across all servers.
16:00 UTC: System was fully operational, with normal traffic levels restored.
16:30 UTC: Monitoring confirmed system stability and all issues were resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution
The problem originated from a recent update to the load balancer configuration. This update incorrectly set the traffic routing to direct all incoming traffic to a single server, causing that server to become overwhelmed and fail. After eliminating potential issues with the database and web server performance, it was discovered that correcting the load balancer configuration resolved the problem by properly distributing traffic across all servers.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvement: Implement stricter validation checks for load balancer configuration updates.

TODO:

Add automated tests to verify load balancer configuration before deployment to prevent misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring systems to detect unbalanced server loads earlier.
Provide additional training for the team on load balancer management and configuration best practices.

14:05 UTC: The DevOps team was notified via an automated alert from the monitoring system.
14:10 UTC: Initial investigation began, focusing on the web server's performance.
14:20 UTC: Misleading debugging paths led the team to suspect a database issue, as response times from the database were slightly elevated.
14:45 UTC: Further investigation revealed that the load balancer was misconfigured.
15:00 UTC: The incident was escalated to the network engineering team to address the load balancer configuration.
15:30 UTC: The load balancer configuration was corrected, and traffic was successfully distributed across all servers.
16:00 UTC: The system was fully operational, and normal traffic levels were restored.
16:30 UTC: Monitoring confirmed that all systems were stable.
Root Cause and Resolution
The issue was caused by a recent update to the load balancer configuration, which unintentionally set the traffic distribution to route all incoming traffic to a single server. This server quickly became overwhelmed, resulting in a significant degradation of service. The problem was identified after eliminating potential database and server performance issues. The solution involved correcting the load balancer configuration to properly distribute traffic across all available servers.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvement: Implement stricter validation checks for load balancer configuration updates.
TODO:
Add automated tests for load balancer configuration to prevent misconfigurations.
Improve monitoring to detect unbalanced server loads earlier.
Provide additional training for the team on load balancer management.
